# AoC2022

Finally, the chillest month of the year has come.

***

This year, I'll do the AoC with C, beacause I started to feel that C++ had a bit too much ADDITIONAL features (You got it, because ++, ...).
More seriously, AoC is such a good opportunity to get more confortable with a language
(I wanted to say learn but, common, I know C++ therefore I already know C, it's just a matter of how conforable am I with the language and its stdlib).

Anyway, this year I will not have time to get really serious about the puzzles, I will just have fun solving them,
(at this point I'm just writing to myself btw, I have no idea why in hell am I still typing on my keyboard).

**

I wish to have fun and good luck for this AoC !
